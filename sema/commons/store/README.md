 (rdf-store)
no __main__ by itself
extend with the ability to expose all content
access to the graph (read-only / cloned? )
at least expose all_triples (as now added in travharv)
formalise named-graph objects (class GraphName) to be something like URIRef & validated
adapt the GraphNameMapper
consider rename of the current 'for_key' methods vs their basis
consider passing down a provenance graph at ingest time (that could maybe go into the admin graph?)
