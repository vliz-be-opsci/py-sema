 (webdiscovery from current travharv)
__main__ to discover and dump (to file or stdout) the found/accumulated rdf for given input uri, with verbose mode to list applied techniques and final loaded urls / provenance data (possibly to separate dump?)
allow providing list of content-types to be loaded (all, not one)
to expose that __main__ as script-wrapper "sema-find"
